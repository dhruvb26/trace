## Thought: I need to inform the supplier about Patagonia's sustainability standards. The best way to do this is by sending an email. Before sending the email, I should retrieve Patagonia's official sustainability requirements to include in the message. Then I will compose the email and send it using the `email_supplier` tool. The final answer will be the content of the email.
## Using tool: get_patagonia_sustainability_requirements

## Thought: Thought: The email failed to send due to an encoding error. This is likely caused by special characters like the registered trademark symbol (Â®) in "bluesignÂ®". I need to remove or replace these characters to make the email content plain ASCII text or ensure the tool can handle UTF-8. Since I cannot modify the tool's encoding handling, I will try removing the problematic characters and resending the email. I will remove the 'Â®' symbol from "bluesignÂ® system partner" and resend the email.
